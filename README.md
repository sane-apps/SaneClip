## 🚨 The Problem

Most clipboard managers are **security nightmares**:
- ❌ Store your passwords, API keys, and credit cards in **plaintext**
- ❌ Send your clipboard data to the **cloud**
- ❌ Track everything you copy with **analytics**
- ❌ Let **any app** access your clipboard history without permission

**You deserve better.**

---

## ✅ The Solution

SaneClip is the **first clipboard manager** built with security as the foundation:

| Security Feature | What It Does |
|------------------|--------------|
| **🔒 AES-256-GCM Encryption (Pro)** | Encrypts your clipboard history at rest. Even if malware accesses your disk, it can't read your clips. |
| **🔐 Touch ID History Lock (Pro)** | Locks history behind biometrics. 30-second grace period means no repeated prompts. |
| **🛡️ Keychain Integration** | All secrets (webhook keys, encryption keys) stored in macOS Keychain — never in JSON files. |
| **🚫 HTTPS Enforcement** | Webhooks must use HTTPS (localhost exempt for testing). No accidental plaintext transmission. |
| **⚠️ URL Scheme Confirmation** | Destructive commands (copy, paste, clear) require user approval. No silent data loss. |
| **📵 App Exclusions** | Block 1Password, banking apps, or any sensitive app from clipboard capture entirely. |
| **🕵️ Sensitive Data Detection** | Automatically flags credit cards, SSNs, API keys, passwords, private keys. |

**100% local. Zero cloud. Zero analytics. Zero telemetry.**

- **Auto-Trim Whitespace** — Remove leading/trailing whitespace
- **Lowercase URLs** — Convert URLs to lowercase
- **Normalize Line Endings** — Convert to consistent line breaks
- **Remove Duplicate Spaces** — Collapse multiple spaces

### Organization

- **🔄 Duplicate Detection** — Identical clips automatically consolidate
- **📊 Paste Count Badges** — Track how many times you've used each item
- **⏱️ Auto-Expire** — Delete old items after 1h, 24h, 7d, or 30d
- **🖼️ Image Capture** — Copies images too, not just text

### macOS Widgets

## 📦 Distribution Versions

SaneClip is available in two versions with different capabilities:

| Feature | Direct Download | Mac App Store |
|---------|:--------------------:|:-------------:|
| Clipboard History & Search | ✅ | ✅ |
| AES-256-GCM Encryption | ✅ | ✅ |
| Touch ID Protection | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sensitive Data Detection | ✅ | ✅ |
| Snippets & Text Transforms | ✅ | ✅ |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | ✅ | ✅ |
| Siri Shortcuts & Widgets | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Auto-Paste into apps** | ✅ One-click paste | ❌ Copies to clipboard; press Cmd+V to paste |
| **Automatic Updates** | ✅ Built-in auto-updater | ✅ Via App Store |
| **iCloud Sync** | ❌ | ✅ |

> **Why the difference?** The Mac App Store version runs in Apple's sandbox, which blocks simulated keyboard events (used for auto-paste). Instead, the App Store version copies items to your clipboard and shows a notification — just press Cmd+V to paste. All other features work identically.

**Direct download:** [$6.99 one-time at saneclip.com](https://saneclip.com) — includes Sparkle auto-updates.

---

## 📱 iOS Companion App (Free)
